Although my tv is a smart tv, I wanted something that would put all my entertainment into one convenient location. I also own a projector, and I have recently been struggling with my laptop or xbox in order to watch movies. The Fire-stick would offer a more portable way of getting everything I wanted to stream through my projector. The stick arrived this morning, in a small recyclable box, and inside I found the stick, an Alexa voice remote, two AAA amazon batteries, a plug, a micro usb cable and a HDMI extension cable for improved WI-FI connectivity. My first impression of the device was how great it looks. It has a matt black finish with the familiar glossy Amazon smile. Everything about this product is top quality. I removed the packaging and read the simple, easy to follow instructions, and within minutes I was up and running. I plugged it in and connected it to the HDMI port on my TV and setup was seamless. It did a quick update and then I was ready to go. I was able to install all of the TV apps that I needed, including Netflix, Prime, Disney+ and for the first time, Apple TV +. I haven't yet been able to watch Apple TV+ on a TV as I didn't have anything compatible with the app, and the website required a credit card, which I don't have. This was an added bonus that I wasn't expecting from the fire stick. Alongside the well known entertainment apps, there are also many more than can be installed. Alongside movie apps, you can get music, games and even the weather. The quality of the visuals is stunning, and although this isn't the 4K version, it upscales everything on my 4K TV to HDR10 which is almost the same quality as 4K. To the untrained eye, it has stunning image quality. The addition of dolby atmos support on this model is also great, as it gives me the option to be able to watch movies with the best possible audio quality. The user interface is simple and clean, and a pleasure to navigate, and the remote control works seamlessly. The Alexa voice control function can be used across the device and enabled on many apps so that you need never push a button. The Fire-stick is small and stays out of sight, and only one cable from the back of the TV shows its presence. I honestly can't say anything bad about this device, and the new updated 3rd generation processors means it is fast, and doesn't keep me waiting around. I can simply load up a film or a tv show whenever I wish. It will also be perfect for my projector and it will make watching movies on the big screen more of a pleasure than a chore. If you have been looking to get a Fire-stick, but are on the fence, I urge you to get down from it and buy one. You won't regret it. 5*\n", "Review_Rating": 5, "No_of_people_reacted_helpful": 277, "URL": "https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07ZZW3KJY", "Author_Profile": "https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGV5CF4IFFG2COZRHRBRA33KKVWQ/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8", "Review_URL": "https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/customer-reviews/R21AW6PVMVBPBN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07ZZW3KJY"},

It shows on screen that it\u2019s sound is being output in HDR and the quality is superb. I have a reasonable home audio system and I am sure many Amazon clients will have better and more expensive systems than I. I was surprised it is a plug in to HDMI as in my ignorance thought it would be USB. Only downside I can see is that as others had mentioned the power lead must be near an electrical power socket. My LG OLED is on a wall bracket that has an arm that means easy to access back for connections plus I have a double power socket half way up my wall by the TV. Plugged into HDMI 3 as my Sky Q  box is on HDMI 2 (Arc) through my Sony Amp. Put amp on TV setting and I was blown away by the sound both for Apple TV and audio apps. I know you can now get a Sky Q box swap over for \u00a350 to HDR and now more ready than ever to do that after hearing this HDR audio.\n", "Review_Rating": 5, "No_of_people_reacted_helpful": 8, "URL": "https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07ZZW3KJY", "Author_Profile": "https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFGWVW5H6T6P4FBL3ZSHHMPCCQYA/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8", "Review_URL": "https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/customer-reviews/R29P6PTJCHS6WY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07ZZW3KJY"},

I'd youtubed, opened it up and cleaned the swich rubber and contacts. Slight improvements. Repeated clean - no change. Searched for relacement and up popped the FireTV stick. The reviews were positive and the price was cheaper than a Humax replacement, and not much more than an unbranded replacement.", "Review_Rating": 5, "No_of_people_reacted_helpful": 0, "URL": "https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07ZZW3KJY", "Author_Profile": "https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AED7N252VLKTQPFVTXWULEVD5NQA/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8", "Review_URL": "https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/customer-reviews/R6FW12XI1QEV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07ZZW3KJY"},

I can\u2019t get it on my 4K one, thankfully because it sucks and I can\u2019t change it back.
